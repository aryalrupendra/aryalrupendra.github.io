Hi, I am Rupendra, a Research Associate at the Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore (SERIS), where I contribute to the Building-Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) Group, focusing on the development of beautiful, safe, and reliable solar modules. My current work involves the design, fabrication, and testing of architectural photovoltaic tiles for a wide range of building applications. I have strong interests in computer-aided design (CAD), rapid prototyping, mechatronics, and new product development, transforming concepts into practical solutions.<br/>
I like to spend my time in design and testing of Machines and Robots.<br/>
<br/>
I have degrees in mechanical engineering from IIT Kanpur [India] and IOE Thapathali Campus [Nepal]. <br/>
